Aparejador will be a modular autorig


The first step will be to create a simple body rig without bendys/toonies 
and not ready for games, ideally this is the minimum to be done with 
this masterclass

Second step will be the base of a face (jaw, eyes, checks, maybe brows)

Third step will be to add bendys for legs and arms, and make it ready 
for games as an option
